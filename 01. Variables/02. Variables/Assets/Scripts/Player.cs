	/// To create variables there are 3 required components with an optional 4th:
	/// 1. public or private reference ("Who can access this information?")
	/// 	public = everyone can access the variable, can be seen and manipulated in the Unity editor
	/// 	private = only this script has control of the variable.
	/// 2. data type ("What kind of variable is this?")
	/// 	3 common types:
	///			string (characters of text e.g. a name, a sentence)
	///			bool (logical true or false)
	///			float (decimal number)
	///			int (whole number)
	///	3. name
	/// 4. value (optional)
